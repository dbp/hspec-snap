0.3.1.0 - 2014-10-27 - Remove broken `afterAll` implementation and depend on hspec2 0.5,
	which provides a correct implementation.

0.3.0.0 - 2014-10-18 - Add support for factories, and no longer export `afterAll`.
	A more correct implementation of `afterAll` is currently in hspec2
	HEAD, and will be released soon (and we don't want to have to do
	another major version when it does).

0.2.0.0 - 2014-9-24 - Change order of parameters in predicates that take two arguments
	to make pattern of `get req >>= shouldHaveProp foo` work (vs needing to call `flip`).
	And add more predicates.

0.1.0.0 - 2014-9-3 - Initial release.
